    <h1>Fight For Your Voting Rights Now!</h1>
    <h3>Many states are restricting voting in an act to prevent Generation-Z, minorities, and previously incarcerated people from voting.</h3>

    <!--- About --->
    <h2>About My Topic</h2>
    <p>What is the problem my topic covers? Why is it a problem?
    </p>
    <p>My topic will cover voting suppression that is currently happening within the United States. After the former President Trump refused to concede and went on to say that the election was rigged, this pushed a lot of the younger generation into voting. Republicians don't like that. Lorem Impsum. </p>
